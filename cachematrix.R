## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

#This script is the solution to R-programming assignment of week 3 
#from the Coursera course
#The functions below have been designed to calculate the inverse of 
#a matrix in a cache form

## Write a short comment describing this function

#This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL                             ## to hold value of matrix inverse 
  set <- function(y) {                    ## define the set function to assign new 
    x <<- y                             ## value of matrix in parent environment
    inv <<- NULL                        ## if there is a new matrix, reset inv to NULL
  }
  get <- function() x                     ## define the get function - returns value of the matrix argument
  
  setinverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse  ## assigns value of inv in parent environment
  getinverse <- function() inv                     ## gets the value of inv where called
  list(set = set, get = get, setinverse = setinverse, getinverse = getinverse)  ## you need this in order to refer 
  ## to the functions with the $ operator
  

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

# This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
# If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed),
# then cacheSolve will retrieve the inverse from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  
  inv <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(inv)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(inv)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(inv)
  inv
}
